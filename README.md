Startup Funding Calculator
==

Under the /oom directory, a nomograph to calculate how much funding your startup will need to reach profitability.

This requires an installation of tlbcore (https://github.com/tlbtlbtlb/tlbcore) symlinked to this directory.

To test locally, ```$ make run```. It will start Node.JS and create a server on 127.0.0.1:8000.
